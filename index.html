    <h2>Early life and Education</h2>
    <p>Grace Hopper was born on December 6th, 1906, in New York City. In her childhood, she had an inherent curiosity as to how things worked to the point of disassembling seven alarm clocks to understand their inner workings. Little did she know that she would develop revolutionary concepts in technological history.</p>

    <p>With this nature, she graduated from Vassar College with honors in mathematics and physics in 1928. After gaining her bachelor's degree, she continued to study at Yale, earning her master's and PhD in mathematics. She then returned to Vassar College to teach mathematics for the next decade.</p>

    <p>Throughout her education, Hopper stood out not only for her academic ability but also for entering a field where very few women were present. Studying advanced mathematics in the 1920s required determination, confidence, and resilience. Her academic success became the foundation for her later achievements, and it demonstrated early on that she was willing to challenge expectations and push boundaries.</p>
