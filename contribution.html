    <h1>Technological Contributions</h1>

    <p>After World War 2 began, Hopper felt compelled to serve her country. Despite being too old to enlist at 37, she was commissioned as lieutenant and assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University. She then joined the programming team, developing the Harvard Mark I computer. This was the first electromechanical computer in the US. This machine was crucial for wartime calculations.</p>

    <p>After the war, she became the senior mathematician on the Universal Automatic Computer project (UNIVAC I) and the UNIVAC II. UNIVAC was the first commercial electronic digital computer. Hopper developed new ways of using the computer to code. During this period, Hopper began developing new ideas for programming. At the time, programmers wrote in machine code, which was extremely difficult to read and write. Hopper believed that programming languages should look more like English, so more people could understand them. She proposed the idea of a compiler, a tool that translates English-like instructions into machine code. She completed the first compiler in 1952. Her work eventually led to the development of COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language), one of the first high-level programming languages.</p>

    <p>The impact of COBOL on the business world lasted many decades. It became the dominant language for business computing in the 1960s to the 1980s, and to this day remains in use in government agencies and financial institutions. It is crucial for running for banking systems, doing their core transaction processing on there, government services, insurance companies and healthcare.</p>
