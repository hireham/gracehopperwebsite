    <h1>Modern Relevance</h1>

    <p>Grace Hopper's invention of the compiler remains one of the most fundamental contributions to computer science. Whenever you write code in Python, JavaScript, or any other high-level language, a compiler changes your human readable code into machine instructions. If we didn't have compilers, we would still be writing programs in binary.</p>

    <p>Hopper broke barriers as a woman in computing and the military at a time when both fields were dominated by men. The Grace Hopper Celebration, an annual conference for women in computing that began in 1994, honours her memory and continues her mission of making technology more inclusive. The conference brings together thousands of women technologists, students, and researchers, creating networking opportunities and showcasing achievements in computing. Additionally, numerous scholarships, awards, and programs bear Hopper's name, ensuring that new generations learn about her contributions and are inspired to pursue careers in technology.</p>

    <p>Hopper was also known for her optimism, saying in an interview "I think we consistently...underestimate what we can do with computers if we really try," in response to a question about whether the computer revolution is over. Her response reflects her belief in pushing boundaries, embracing innovation, and pursuing ideas that may initially seem impossible. This mindset continues to influence the culture of modern computer science and encourages ongoing progress in the field.</p>
